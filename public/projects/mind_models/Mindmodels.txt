There are many advantages of visualizing mental space.

Visualization can improve communication between people. 
It is very difficult to talk about something that cannot be seen, like our thoughts. 
If we were able to see our mind space communication between people would be more accurate. 
The effects of visualization are similar to other communication technologies like the printing press, or the internet. 
Allow deeper collaboration between people, therefore the possibility of forminig larger, more efficient and smarter groups. 

Visualization can support the process of self discovery.

As an example consider the language of mathematics, known for dealing with invisible things. Abstract. 
We use symbols to 'see' mathematical objects. 
This allows for communication between mathematicians.
The results of years of work is shared, and capitalized by peers.
These are the shoulders on which Newton, and many others have stood. 

At the same time, mathematical notation allows the contemplation of complex ideas. 
Progress made on a train of thought can be stored and continued later, with renewed energy. 

This is true of other languages as well. 

Would the objects in our mental space benefit likewise from a visualization? I believe so. 

Vippassana is the practice of observing mental activity.
